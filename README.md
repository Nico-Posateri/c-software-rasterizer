# C Software Rasterizer

A simple C software for real-time rasterization, featuring models made in Blender.

<sup>A cube showcasing a wireframe volume, backface culling, shaded faces, affine texture mapping, perspective corrected textures, and correctly inverted UVs. The texture featured is an unused asset produced by **Rare Limited** for *Banjo Tooie* on the N64.</sup>

> [!NOTE]
> I am planning on implementing parallel and subpixel rasterization before uploading this project, as well as support for multiple meshes.

## Directory Information

This engine uses [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5), as well as [elanthis' upng](https://github.com/elanthis/upng), a png decoder for custom textures. By default, the program will render a static cube with no texture.

The following is a list of key inputs and their functions:
- **esc** - Closes the program
- **w** - Moves the camera forward
- **a** - Rotates the camera left
- **s** - Moves the camera backward
- **d** - Rotates the camera right
- &#8593; - Raises the camera
- &#8595; - Lowers the camera
- **c** - Culls backfaces
- **r** - Renders backfaces
- **1** - Renders the mesh wireframe with vertices
- **2** - Renders the mesh wireframe
- **3** - Renders the mesh with filled faces
- **4** - Renders the mesh wireframe with filled faces
- **5** - Renders the mesh wireframe with filled faces and vertices
- **6** - Renders the mesh textured
- **7** - Renders the mesh textured with a wireframe
- **8** - Renders the mesh textured with a wireframe and vertices
